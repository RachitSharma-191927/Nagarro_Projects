    <h1>Pokemon</h1>
    <p>
      Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
      February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became
      wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series,
      originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles,
      was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans
      as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
      trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other
      Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises
      in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.

    <h2>Charizard</h2>
    <p>
      Charizard (known as Lizardon in Japan) is a character of the Pokémon anime
      and video game series. Ash, one of the main characters in the series, owns
      a Charizard. Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charizards are violent yet
      honorable creatures, flying proudly around the sky and always looking for
      powerful enemies to fight with. Charizard is also the version mascot of
      Pokémon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts
      of many other Pokémon games. During an interview, Pokémon Company
      president Tsunekazu Ishihara said that they knew Charizard would be
      popular with North Americans, because they like strong, powerful
      characters.
