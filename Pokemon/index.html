  <h1>Pokemon</h1>
  <p>
    Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
    February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became
    wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series,
    originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles,
    was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans
    as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
    trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other
    Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises
    in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.

  <h2>Charizard</h2>
  <p>
    Charizard (known as Lizardon in Japan) is a character of the Pokémon anime
    and video game series. Ash, one of the main characters in the series, owns
    a Charizard. Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charizards are violent yet
    honorable creatures, flying proudly around the sky and always looking for
    powerful enemies to fight with. Charizard is also the version mascot of
    Pokémon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts
    of many other Pokémon games. During an interview, Pokémon Company
    president Tsunekazu Ishihara said that they knew Charizard would be
    popular with North Americans, because they like strong, powerful
    characters.
